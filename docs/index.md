# chemistry_MEP_TS_Optimization

Welcome to the documentation for the `chemistry_MEP_TS_optimization` code!
This python package provides functionality to obtain minimum energy path (MEP)
connecting two minima (namely, reactant and product for a chemical system)
which passes through a saddle point (called, the transition state for a chemical system).
